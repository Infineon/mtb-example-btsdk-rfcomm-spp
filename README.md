# SPP app

## Overview
The SPP application uses the SPP profile library to establish, terminate, send, and receive SPP data over BR/EDR. This sample supports a single SPP connection.

## Features demonstrated
- Use of the AIROC&#8482; SPP library

## Instructions
To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps:

1. Build and download the application to the AIROC&#8482; board.
2. Open the ClientControl application and open the "WICED HCI" serial port for the device. Default baud rate configured in the application is defined by the BSP HCI\_UART\_DEAULT\_BAUD #define, usually either 3M or 115200 depending on board UART capabilities.
3. Run the BTSpy program to view protocol and application traces.
4. On Windows 10 PCs, right click on the Bluetooth&#174; icon in the system tray and select 'Add a Bluetooth Device'. Find and pair with the spp app. That will create an incoming and an outgoing COM port on your computer. Right click on the Bluetooth&#174; icon in the system tray and select 'Open Settings', scroll down and select "More Bluetooth options" and then select the 'COM Ports' tab.
5. Use application such as TeraTerm to open the outgoing COM port. Opening the port will create the SPP connection.
6. Type any key on the terminal of the outgoing COM port, the spp application will receive the key.
7. For 20721B2 based AIROC&#8482; kits, use the Custom button on audio shield board as application button rather than the button on the base board.

## Notes
See the spp.c file for compile flag options for different modes of testing. CYW9M2BASE-43012BT does not support SEND\_DATA ON INTERRUPT because the platform does not have button connected to the AIROC&#8482; board.

To test SEND\_DATA ON INTERRUPT with CYW943012BTEVK-01, the audio shield board should be removed. To make use of the USER button a jumper wire should be installed to connect P00 from A2 (J2 pin 3) to RSVD\_1\_USER\_BTN (J12 pin 1).

## Application Settings
- SEND\_DATA
    - This command line option enables sends data to peer side. Use parameter INTERRUPT or TIMEOUT.
    - If INTERRUPT is used then the application sends 1 MB data to the peer application on every App button press on the AIROC&#8482; board. This is default.
    - It TIMEOUT is used then the application sends 4 bytes every second while session is up.

- LOOPBACK\_DATA
    -  If LOOPBACK_DATA=1, the app sends back received data.

## BTSTACK version

BTSDK AIROC&#8482; chips contain the embedded AIROC&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; stack, BTSTACK. Different chips use different versions of BTSTACK, so some assets may contain variant sets of files targeting the different versions in COMPONENT\_btstack\_vX (where X is the stack version). Applications automatically include the appropriate folder using the COMPONENTS make variable mechanism, and all BSPs declare which stack version should be used in the BSP .mk file, with a declaration such as:<br>
> COMPONENTS+=btstack\_v1<br>
or:<br>
> COMPONENTS+=btstack\_v3

## Common application settings

Application settings below are common for all BTSDK applications and can be configured via the makefile of the application or passed in via the command line.

##### BT\_DEVICE\_ADDRESS
> Set the BDA (Bluetooth&#174; Device Address) for your device. The address is 6 bytes, for example, 20819A10FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the host PC MAC address.

##### UART
> Set to the UART port you want to use to download the application. For example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED\_HCI\_UART0' on Linux or '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS. By default, the SDK will auto-detect the port.

##### ENABLE_DEBUG
> For HW debugging, configure ENABLE\_DEBUG=1. See the document [AIROC&#8482;-Hardware-Debugging](https://infineon.github.io/btsdk-docs/BT-SDK/AIROC-Hardware-Debugging.pdf) for more information. This setting configures GPIO for SWD.<br>
>
   - CYW920819EVB-02/CYW920820EVB-02: SWD signals are shared with D4 and D5, see SW9 in schematics.
   - CYBT-213043-MESH/CYBT-213043-EVAL/CYBT-253059-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P12=SWDCK and P13=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
   - CYBT-223058-EVAL/CYW920835M2EVB-01/CYBT-243053-EVAL/CYBLE-343072-EVAL-M2B/CYBLE-333074-EVAL-M2B/CYBLE-343072-MESH/Vela-IF820-INT-ANT-DVK/Vela-IF820-EXT-ANT-DVK: SWD signals are routed to P02=SWDCK and P03=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
   - CYBT-263065-EVAL/CYBT-273063-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P02=SWDCK and P04=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
   - CYBT-343026-EVAL/CYBT-353027-EVAL/CYBT-333047-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P11=SWDCK and P15=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
   - CYBT-413055-EVAL/CYBT-413061-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P16=SWDCK and P17=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
   - CYW989820EVB-01: SWDCK (P02) is routed to the J13 DEBUG connector, but not SWDIO. Add a wire from J10 pin 3 (PUART CTS) to J13 pin 2 to connect GPIO P10 to SWDIO.
   - CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01: PUART RX/TX signals are shared with SWDCK and SWDIO. Remove RX and TX jumpers on J10 when using SWD. PUART and SWD cannot be used simultaneously on this board unless these pins are changed from the default configuration.
   - CYW920721M2EVK-02/CYW920721M2EVB-03: The default setup uses P03 for SWDIO and P05 for SWDCK. Check the position of SW15 if using JLink with the DEBUG connector.
   - CYW920706WCDEVAL: SWD debugging requires fly-wire connections. The default setup P15 (J22 pin 3 or J24 pin 1) for SWDIO and P11 (J23 pin 5
    or J22 pin 4) for SWDCK.
   - CYW920736M2EVB-01: SWD hardware debugging requires fly-wire connections. The only option is using P14 for SWDCK and P15 for SWDIO. These route to Arduino header J2, A1 and A0. These can be fly-wired to Arduino header J4, D4 and D5. From there the signals connect to the KitProg3 SWD bridge. In addition, the debug macros (SETUP\_APP\_FOR\_DEBUG\_IF\_DEBUG\_ENABLED and BUSY\_WAIT\_TILL\_MANUAL\_CONTINUE\_IF\_DEBUG\_ENABLED) are placed in sparinit.c in code common to all applications for this device. Most applications for this device call bleprofile\_GPIOInit() in subsequent code, overwriting the SWD pin configuration. To use hardware debugging after the call to bleprofile\_GPIOInit(), place the debug macros in code after that call.
   - CYW943012B2EVK-01: SWD signals are shared with D4 and D5.
   - CYW920820M2EVB-01 & CYW920819M2EVB-01: The default setup uses P03 for SWDIO and P02 for SWDCK. Check the position of SW15 if using JLink with the DEBUG connector.
   - CYW989820M2EVB-01: SWD hardware debugging requires a fly-wire connection to use P14 for SWDIO. P2 is connected directly to SWDCK / ARD_D4. Fly-wire P14 / ARD_D8 on J3.10 to J4.3 / ARD_D5 to connect SWDIO.

   - SWD hardware debugging is not supported on the following:
      - CYW920721M2EVK-01

      - CYW9M2BASE-43012BT
      - CYBT-423054-EVAL
      - CYBT-423060-EVAL
      - CYBT-483056-EVAL
      - CYBT-483062-EVAL
      - CYW955572BTEVK-01
      - CYW943022BTEVK-01

##### DIRECT_LOAD
> BTSDK chips support downloading applications either to FLASH storage or to RAM storage. Some chips support only one or the other, and some chips support both.

> If a chip only supports one or the other, this variable is not applicable, applications will be downloaded to the appropriate storage supported by the device.

> If a chip supports both FLASH and RAM downloads, the default is to download to FLASH, and the DIRECT_LOAD make variable may be set to 1 in the application makefile (or in the command line make command) to override the default and download to RAM.

> Currently, the following chips support both FLASH and RAM download and can set DIRECT_LOAD=1 if desired:
>
   - CYW20835
   - CYW20706

## Building and downloading code examples

1. Install ModusToolbox&#8482; 2.4.1 (or higher).
2. In the ModusToolbox&#8482; Eclipse IDE, click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**).
3. Pick your board for BTSDK under AIROC&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; BSPs.
4. Select the application in the IDE.
5. In the Quick Panel, select **Build** to build the application.
6. To program the board (download the application), select **Program** in the Launches section of the Quick Panel.

**Using command line**

1. Install ModusToolbox&#8482; 2.4.1 (or higher).
2. On Windows, use Cygwin from \ModusToolbox\tools_2.x\modus-shell\Cygwin.bat to build apps.
3. Use the tool 'project-creator-cli' under \ModusToolbox\tools_2.x\project-creator\ to create your application.<br/>
   > project-creator-cli --board-id (BSP) --app-id (appid) -d (dir) <br/>
   See 'project-creator-cli --help' for useful options to list all available BSPs, and all available apps per BSP.<br/>
   For example:<br/>
   > project-creator-cli --app-id mtb-example-btsdk-empty --board-id CYW920706WCDEVAL -d .<br/>
4. To build the app call make build. For example:<br/>
   > cd mtb-examples-btsdk-empty<br/>
   > make build<br/>
5. To program (download to) the board, call:<br/>
   > make qprogram<br/>
6. To build and program (download to) the board, call:<br/>
   > make program<br/><br>
   Note: make program = make build + make qprogram

If you have issues downloading to the board, follow the steps below:

- Press and hold the 'Recover' button on the board.
- Press and hold the 'Reset' button on the board.
- Release the 'Reset' button.
- After one second, release the 'Recover' button.

Note: this is only applicable to boards that download application images to FLASH storage. Boards that only support RAM download (DIRECT_LOAD) such as CYW9M2BASE-43012BT or CYW943022BTEVK-01 can be power cycled to boot from ROM.

## Over The Air (OTA) Firmware Upgrade
Applications that support OTA upgrade can be updated via the peer OTA app in:<br>
>\<Workspace Dir>\mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\tools\btsdk-peer-apps-ota<br>

See the readme.txt file located in the above folder for instructions.<br>
To generate the OTA image for the app, configure OTA\_FW\_UPGRADE=1 in the app
makefile, or append OTA\_FW\_UPGRADE=1 to a build command line, for example:
> make PLATFORM=CYW920706WCDEVAL OTA\_FW\_UPGRADE=1 build<br>

This will the generate \<app>.bin file in the 'build' folder.

## Tracing
To view application traces, there are 2 methods available. Note that the
application needs to configure the tracing options.<br>

1. "WICED Peripheral UART" - Open this port on your computer using a serial port
utility such as TeraTerm or PuTTY (usually using 115200 baud rate for non-Mesh apps, and 921600 for Mesh apps).<br>
2. "WICED HCI UART" - Open this port on your computer using the Client Control
application mentioned above (usually using 3M baud rate). Then run the BTSpy
utility mentioned above.

## Using BSPs (platforms)

BTSDK BSPs are located in the \mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder by default.

#### a. Selecting an alternative BSP

The application makefile has a default BSP. See "TARGET". The makefile also has a list of other BSPs supported by the application. See "SUPPORTED_TARGETS". To select an alternative BSP, use Library Manager from the Quick Panel to deselect the current BSP and select an alternate BSP. Then right-click the newly selected BSP and choose 'Set Active'.  This will automatically update TARGET in the application makefile.

#### b. Custom BSP

## Using libraries

The libraries needed by the app can be found in in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries folder. To add an additional library to your application, launch the Library Manager from the Quick Panel to add a library. Then update the makefile variable "COMPONENTS" of your application to include the library. For example:<br/>
   COMPONENTS += fw\_upgrade\_lib
