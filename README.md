# SPP app

## Overview
The SPP application uses the SPP profile library to establish, terminate, send, and receive SPP data over BR/EDR. This sample supports a single SPP connection.

## Features demonstrated
- Use of Bluetooth SPP library

## Instructions
To demonstrate the app, work through the following steps:

1. Build and download the application to the WICED board.
2. Open the BT/BLE Profile Client Control application and open the port for WICED HCI for the device. Default baud rate configured in the application is defined by the BSP HCI\_UART\_DEAULT\_BAUD #define, usually either 3M or 115200 depending on board UART capabilities.
3. Run the BTSpy program to view protocol and application traces.
4. On Windows 10 PCs, right click on the Bluetooth icon in the system tray and select 'Add a Bluetooth Device'. Find and pair with the spp app. That will create an incoming and an outgoing COM port on your computer. Right click on the Bluetooth icon in the system tray and select 'Open Settings', scroll down and select "More Bluetooth options" and then select the 'COM Ports' tab.
5. Use application such as Term Term to open the outgoing COM port. Opening the port will create the SPP connection.
6. Type any key on the terminal of the outgoing COM port, the spp application will receive the key.
7. By default, (SEND\_DATA\_ON\_INTERRUPT=1) the application sends 1 MB data to the peer application on every App button press on the WICED board.
8. If desired, edit the spp.c file to configure the application to send data on a timer to the peer application by setting SEND\_DATA\_ON\_INTERRUPT=0 and SEND\_DATA\_ON\_TIMEOUT=1
9. For 20721B2 based WICED kits, use the Custom button on audio shield board as application button rather than the button on the base board.

## Notes
See the spp.c file for compile flag options for different modes of testing. CYW9M2BASE-43012BT does not support SEND\_DATA\_ON\_INTERRUPT because the platform does not have button connected to BT board.

To test SEND\_DATA\_ON\_INTERRUPT with CYW943012BTEVK-01, the audio shield board should be removed. To make use of the USER button a jumper wire should be installed to connect P00 from A2 (J2 pin 3) to RSVD_1_USER_BTN (J12 pin 1).

## Common application settings

Application settings below are common for all BTSDK applications and can be configured via the makefile of the application or passed in via the command line.

- BT\_DEVICE\_ADDRESS<br/>
    - Set the BDA (Bluetooth Device Address) for your device. The address is 6 bytes, for example, 20819A10FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the host PC MAC address.

- UART<br/>
    - Set to the UART port you want to use to download the application. For example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED\_HCI\_UART0' on Linux or '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS. By default, the SDK will auto-detect the port.

- ENABLE_DEBUG<br/>
    - For HW debugging, select the option '1'. See the document [WICED-Hardware-Debugging](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/btsdk-docs/blob/master/docs/BT-SDK/WICED-Hardware-Debugging.pdf) for more information. This setting configures GPIO for SWD.
      - CYW920819EVB-02/CYW920820EVB-02: SWD signals are shared with D4 and D5, see SW9 in schematics.
      - CYBT-213043-MESH/CYBT-213043-EVAL : SWD signals are routed to P02=SWDCK and P03=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
	  - CYBT-223058-EVAL : SWD signals are routed to P02=SWDCK and P03=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
	  - CYBT-243053-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P12=SWDCK and P13=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
	  - CYBT-253059-EVAL: SWD signals are routed to P12=SWDCK and P13=SWDIO. Use expansion connectors to connect VDD, GND, SWDCK, and SWDIO to your SWD Debugger probe.
      - CYW989820EVB-01: SWDCK (P02) is routed to the J13 DEBUG connector, but not SWDIO. Add a wire from J10 pin 3 (PUART CTS) to J13 pin 2 to connect GPIO P10 to SWDIO.
      - CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01: PUART RX/TX signals are shared with SWDCK and SWDIO. Remove RX and TX jumpers on J10 when using SWD. PUART and SWD cannot be used simultaneously on this board unless these pins are changed from the default configuration.
      - CYW920721B2EVK-02: SWD hardware debugging supported. SWD signals are shared with D4 and D5, see SW9 in schematics.
      - CYW920721B2EVK-03, CYW920721M2EVK-01: SWD hardware debugging is not supported.
      - CYW920721M2EVK-02: SWD hardware debugging is supported. The default setup uses P03 for SWDIO and P05 for SWDCK.
      - CYW920706WCDEVAL: SWD debugging requires fly-wire connections. The default setup uses P15 (J22 pin 3) for SWDIO and P30 (J19 pin 2) for SWDCK. P30 is shared with BTN1.
      - CYW920735Q60EVB-01: SWD hardware debugging supported. The default setup uses the J13 debug header, P3 (J13 pin 2) for SWDIO and P2 (J13 pin 4) for SWDCK.  They can be optionally routed to D4 and D4 on the Arduino header J4, see SW9 in schematics.
      - CYW920835REF-RCU-01: SWD hardware debugging is not supported.
      - CYW9M2BASE-43012BT: SWD hardware debugging is not supported.
      - CYW943012BTEVK-01: SWD hardware debugging is not supported.

See README.md in the sub-folders for more information.

## ModusToolbox Tools

Source code generation tools installed by ModusToolbox installer:

- Device Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create custom pin mappings for your device.
- Bluetooth Configurator:
      A GUI tool to create and configure the LE GATT Database and BR/EDR SDP records for your application.

## Using BSPs (platforms)

BTSDK BSPs are located in the \mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder by default.

#### a. Selecting an alternative BSP

The application makefile has a default BSP. See "TARGET". The makefile also has a list of other BSPs supported by the application. See "SUPPORTED_TARGETS". To select an alternative BSP, use Library Manager from the Quick Panel to deselect the current BSP and select an alternate BSP. Then right-click the newly selected BSP and choose 'Set Active'.  This will automatically update TARGET in the application makefile.

#### b. Custom BSP

**Complete BSP**

To create and use a complete custom BSP that you want to use in applications, perform the following steps:

1. Select an existing BSP you wish to use as a template from the list of supported BSPs in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder.
2. Make a copy in the same folder and rename it. For example mtb\shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp.<br/>
   **Note:** This can be done in the system File Explorer and then refresh the workspace in Eclipse to see the new project.  Delete the .git sub-folder from the newly copied folder before refreshing in Eclipse.
   If done in the IDE, an error dialog may appear complaining about items in the .git folder being out of sync.  This can be resolved by deleting the .git sub-folder in the newly copied folder.

3. In the new mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp folder, rename the existing/original (BSP).mk file to mybsp.mk.
4. In the application makefile, set TARGET=mybsp and add it to SUPPORTED\_TARGETS as well as TARGET\_DEVICE\_MAP.  For example: mybsp/20819A1
5. Update design.modus for your custom BSP if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
6. Update the application makefile as needed for other custom BSP specific attributes and build the application.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Multiple Apps**

To create a custom pin configuration to be used by multiple applications using an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus in the existing BSP folder. For example mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_CYW920819EVB-02\COMPONENT\_my\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP COMPONENT\_bsp\_design\_modus folder under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in the newly created COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=my\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under a GeneratedSource folder in the new COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Per App**

To create a custom configuration to be used by a single application from an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(BSP)\_design\_modus in your application. For example COMPONENT\_CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in this folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(BSP)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=CYW920721B2EVK-03\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under the GeneratedSource folder in your application.


## Using libraries

The libraries needed by the app can be found in in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries folder. To add an additional library to your application, launch the Library Manager from the Quick Panel to add a library. Then update the makefile variable "COMPONENTS" of your application to include the library. For example:<br/>
   COMPONENTS += fw\_upgrade\_lib
